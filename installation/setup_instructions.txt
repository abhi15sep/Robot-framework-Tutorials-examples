Robot Framework setup on Linux 

On Ubuntu :

# Use python package management tool pip and it will make most of your installation easier

1.Initial base needed packages
sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo apt-get install python-pip

2.Installing and Setting up actual robotframework 
sudo pip install robotframework
sudo pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary

3.For those who want to use IDE
sudo pip install robotframework-ride

4.Installing External Libraries
sudo pip install robotframework-sshlibrary  
( For this you may need paramiko,  libffi-dev, cryptography )

Installing/building cryptography:

Cryptography should build very easily on Linux provided you have 
a) C compiler
b) headers for Python 
c) headers for the OpenSSL and 
d) libffi libraries available on your system.

For Debian and Ubuntu, the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev

Post this you should now be able to build and install cryptography with the usual.
sudo pip install cryptography

5.Good to have goodies
sudo pip install robotframework-databaselibrary
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
sudo pip install MySQL-python
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk


6. If you want to check post installation, use pip list command

$pip list | grep robot
robotframework (3.0)
robotframework-databaselibrary (0.8)
robotframework-httplibrary (0.4.2)
robotframework-hub (0.9)
robotframework-python3 (2.9)
robotframework-requests (0.4.5)
robotframework-ride (1.5.2.1)
robotframework-scplibrary (1.1.1)
robotframework-selenium2library (1.7.4)
robotframework-seleniumlibrary (2.9.2)
robotframework-sshlibrary (2.1.2)
robotframework-xvfb (1.2.2)


You can find bunch of information on net if you face issues but all or most is taken here in above step unless there ar other dependencies in your environment.
