Let work on the dictionary but at basic level to understand ...  In Python you must be aware of how dictionary are created and used..
 
Let try to see how we can create dictionary using framework provided library "Collection" vs using python

* Create dictionary using library collections
SYNTAX :
  ${dict}=    Create Dictionary  KEY  VALUE
 
  However you will see these WARNING message stating this is not a good way to do..
 
  [ WARN ] Giving keys and values separately to 'Create Dictionary' keyword is deprecated. Use 'key=value' syntax instead.
 
  The reason being this keyword is moved from Collections library to BuiltIn.
 
  Now the correct way to use this keyword would be like this as per the builtin Library documentation

SYNTAX :

     &{dict} =     Create Dictionary     key=value     foo=bar     
 


Lets try in example :

In this example , we will try some new keywords just for the sake of enlarging the scope of understanding

1. We will use couple of keywords from Collections Library

*** Settings ***
Library     Collections

2. We will use keywords for checking the dictionary created

    Dictionary should contain item     ${dict}    foo    bar
 
3. You must have used and seen Set Variable ( local and global usage ), there is another one who does a mix of both but -ONLY- in the context of the test suite scope
     Set Suite Variable       ${dict}
 
4. Lets write the code [ file name : dict.robot ]
 
 *** Settings ***
Library        Collections

*** Test cases ***
TestDictInit
    Dictionary Initialize

    # Notice that this ${dict} variable is set from user keyword and still accessible
    Run Keyword if    ${dict}['COUNTRY'] == 'IND'      Log To console    \n " Land of Sages"

    # --OR-- Check if an item of key`/value must be found in a dictionary
    Dictionary should contain item   ${dict}    COUNTRY   IND

*** Keywords ***
Dictionary Initialize
    &{dict} =     Create Dictionary     COUNTRY=IND

    # Makes a variable available everywhere within the scope of the current suite
    Set Suite Variable   ${dict}
    
    
5. Execute the robot code

$ robot dict.robot
