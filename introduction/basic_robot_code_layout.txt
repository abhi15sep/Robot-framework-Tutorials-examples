Robot Framework Test suite overview

Divided into four distinct sections
* Settings
* Variables
* Test Cases
* Keywords

A simple robot code view showing the 4 sections

*** Settings ***
Library         SSHLibrary

*** Variables ***
${USERNAME}               rango
${PASSWORD}               secrete password
${IP_ADDRESS}             1.2.3.4

*** Test Cases ***
Login to Server
    Open Connection            ${IP_ADDRESSS}
    Login       ${USERNAME}     ${PASSWORD}
    OS version on server

*** Keywords ***
OS version on Sever
    Execute Command                uname -a


------------------------
Decoding the test suite :
------------------------

If you have done some coding earlier may it be shell, python, C/C++, Java etc... here are the sections taht you could relate to or map.


Note : Keyword -> this would be frequently used our discussions ahead. It means that a particular name used in the code is either from 
                  the framework or from the User resource files.

       Test Suite -> Name given to the file which has the test cases. basically the robot file itself is the "Test Suite"

       Test Case  -> Test written inside the Test suite file


Now the 4 main Sections in the code :

*** Settings ***

This is used to import the libraries needed for the test case. Here it show importing Telnet, OS and Selenium Libraries..  etc

Follow syntax Keyword that can be use in *** Settings *** context are Library,Variable, Resource

Example :

*** Settings ***

Library           Telnet 
Library           OperatingSystem
Library           Selenium2Library
Resource          Resource.txt
Variable          myUserDefineVars.py

 


*** Variables ***

This section is for declaring your local variables to use in the code. Follow the syntax  ${VARIABLE_NAME} 

Example :

*** Variables ***
${IP_ADDRESS}   xx.AA.yy.BB 
${USER_ID}      root
${PASSWORD}     rootxxxxx

 

*** Test Cases ***

This section is for defining you test case basically the test executor context.  
The Syntax to follow

TestCaseName  <-- This is your main() test case entry point
    Test Actions  <-- This is your body of the test where

Example:

*** Test Cases ***
LoginToRemoteServer
   [Documentation]   Test to login to remote Sever
   [Tags]            Executute some commands

 

*** Keywords ***

This section is for defining your user define keywords. In Robot Keywords are functions which the test case section will call as test action keywords. 

The syntax is same as that of  *** Test Cases ***

Example :

*** Keywords ***
Open Connection And Log In
   Open Connection  ${IP_ADDRESS}
   set prompt       prompt=$    prompt_is_regexp=true
   Login   ${USER_ID}  ${PASSWORD}
 


Some other info :

[Documentation]
    Used for specifying a test case documentation.
[Tags]
    Used for tagging test cases.
[Setup], [Teardown]
    Specify test setup and teardown.
[Template]
    Specifies the template keyword to use. The test itself will contain only data to use as arguments to that keyword.
[Timeout]
    Used for setting a test case timeout. Timeouts are discussed in their own section.

** You write this 4 sections in your file and there you go you are ready to start running your ROBOT code..
