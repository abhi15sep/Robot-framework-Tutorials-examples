le working with REST server on Robot framework Automation ... You end up using urllib/urllib3  packages library to get data in and out.

Probably you'll also end up seeing this messages on the console...  
This warning are debatable and are there for genuine reason... But for the sake of this topic, we just want to DISABLE that warning message.

WARNING MSG:

InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made. Adding certificate verification is strongly advised. See: https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html


This seems to have fix post python 2.7.xx but I personally couldn't get it working..  
So after days of trying setting, installing, configuring.. nothing works out good..

So back to basics...  

We are running a robot code and through tox or pybot.. We can go and disable the code in the package import file but that's not advisable..

The other way is to shadow the message only through python warnings module inside the robot code...

*** Setting ***

Library    disable_warning_urlib.py

 

where the file   disable_warning_urlib.py   contains code like this

 

$ cat   disable_warning_urlib.py

 

#!/usr/bin/python
import logging
import warnings
import httplib

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

# Hijack the HTTP lib message and Log only once
#httplib.HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 0
requests_log = logging.getLogger("requests.packages.urllib3")
requests_log.setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)
requests_log.propagate = False

class disable_warning_urlib():
    def do_nothing():
        return

 

NOW re run and see that warning and all other possible warning are suppressed for test suite..
