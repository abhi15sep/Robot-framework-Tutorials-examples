DMTF redfish give you a good set of tooling and library to work

Let take https://github.com/DMTF/python-redfish-library

How to use it:

```
$ pip install redfish
```
```
$ pip list | grep redfish
redfish                         2.0.5
```

3 ways you could implement 

1. Use python library in another python and call from robot code

- You could use class inheritance of the redfish class and use directly

Sample Example:

```
from redfish.rest.v1 import HttpClient
class redfish_myclass(HttpClient):
    super(redfish_myclass, self).get, *args, **kwargs)
```

and call from robot code as   `class object.Get    /redfish/v1`


2. Use the request method directly and do GET request but you'll need to
understand the python request http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

Sample Example:

```
    Create Session  openbmc  https://${host}
    ${headers}=  Create Dictionary  Content-Type=application/json

    ${data}=  Create Dictionary  UserName=${username}  Password=${password}

    ${resp}=  Post Request  redfish_session
    ...  /redfish/v1/SessionService/Session  data=${data}  headers=${headers}

    Should Be Equal As Strings  ${resp.status_code}  ${201}
```	

or 

3. Call directly from robot and use as it is.

But here we will show a simpler robot way you can do

Sample Example:
