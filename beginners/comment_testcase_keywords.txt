There are times where we would want to comment a test case or a keyword but not remove from the test suite.

The simplest would be to hash it out but thats not pretty nor good if for a block of test case or keywords.

Robot provides you with a template to hash that out  *** Comments ***

Let me show you with an example:

Say you are commenting the test 2 using hash...

*** Test Cases ***
test 1
    Run Keywords    foo func first

#test 2
#    Run Keywords    foo func second

test 3
    Run Keywords    foo func third
    
*** Keywords ***
foo func first
   Log To Console  \n first

foo func second
   Log To Console  \n second
   
foo func third
   Log To Console  \n third
Now look at this commenting using *** Comments ***

*** Test Cases ***
test 1
    Run Keywords    foo func first

*** Comments ***
test 2
    Run Keywords    foo func second
    
test 3
    Run Keywords    foo func third

*** Keywords ***
foo func first
   Log To Console  \n first

foo func second
   Log To Console  \n second

foo func third
   Log To Console  \n third


Pretty neat huh.. but a word of caution.. any test case bellow test 2 will also get commented. To avoid that, 
you need to follow with the next block with the test case headers as


*** Test Cases ***
test 1
    Run Keywords    foo func first

*** Comments ***
test 2
    Run Keywords    foo func second

*** Test Cases ***
test 3
    Run Keywords    foo func third

*** Keywords ***
foo func first
   Log To Console  \n first

foo func second
   Log To Console  \n second

foo func third
   Log To Console  \n third

Similarly you can do the same for the "user define keywords".
